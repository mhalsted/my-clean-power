# Lost in translation: how to get your data analysis + web-facing technologies to work together effectively

Far too often, a wall divides the processes you use to grab customers' attention on the web and the data analyses you perform to pique customers' interests. Typically, analysis lives on someone's terminal before it is distributed as "answers" to a question, which can mask the techniques used and make it harder to reproduce. On the other hand, the maze of competing web frameworks can keep data analysis from being interactive and easy to use, growing the divide between the analysis and your ultimate consumer. 

R has been a language typically reserved for statistics; yet in the past few years, R has reached a broader audience in becoming one of the most used languages in data science thanks to host of packages that have extended its capabilities. Through a framework called Shiny, data analyses no longer have to live in a terminal but can be shared easily in a responsive environment where web technologies and the underlying data techniques can play well together. This ease of use additionally means you can get started with your own data analysis at a faster rate, without many of the complexities of typical data analysis platforms.

In this talk, we'll learn how a data analysis pipeline can be extended with a server and a user interaction model in mind, connecting the strengths that your teams already have. We'll see that this lives beyond a business scope as well, as it can be applied in the public sector, where, in the example, spatial context to the U.S.'s energy sources can strengthen the messaging of proposed rulemaking.
