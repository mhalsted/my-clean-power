# Lost in translation: how to get your data analysis + web-facing technologies to work together effectively

Far too often, there is a wall that stands between the data analysis used to pique customer interest, and the techniques used to grab the customer's attention. Typically, analysis lives in a terminal, and is only distributed when it is used to "answer" a question. This can mask the techniques and hinder reproducibility. Conversely, the maze of competing web frameworks can keep data analysis from being easy to use, which can grow the divide between the analysis and your ultimate consumer. 

R is a language that used to be reserved for statistics. But recently, R has reached a broader audience - to ascend to one of the most used languages in data science - thanks to a host of new packages. Through a framework called Shiny, data analysis is set free from terminals, where it can be easily shared in a responsive environment and play well with modern web technologies. Plus, its improved usability translates into starting data analysis faster, without the complexities found in typical data analysis platforms.

In this talk, we'll learn how to extend a data analysis pipeline with a server and a user interaction model, connecting the strengths of your team. We look to the public sector for our example, and examine the spatial context of energy sources in the U.S. to create a visual guide for proposed rulemaking.
