# Lost in translation: how to get your data analysis + web-facing technologies to work together effectively

Far too often, there is a wall which stands between the data analyses used to pique customer interest, and actually grabbing the attention of the customer. Typically, the analyses live in a terminal, and is only distributed when it is used to "answer" a question. This can mask the techniques and hinder reproducibility. On the other hand, the maze of competing web frameworks can keep data analysis from being easy to use, thus growing the divide between the analyses and your ultimate consumer. 

R is a language that has been typically reserved for statisticians. Recently, R has reached a broader audience, and has become one of the most used languages in data science thanks to host of new packages. Through a framework called Shiny, data analyses are free from terminals, but can be easily shared in a responsive environment, where together, web technologies can play well with the underlying data techniques. Additionally, this ease of use means you can start with your own data analysis at a faster rate, without the complexities found in typical data analysis platforms.

In this talk, we'll learn how a data analysis pipeline can be extended with a server and a user interaction model, thus connecting the strengths of your team. We look to the public sector for our example, and examine the spatial context of energy sources in the U.S. to create a visual guide for proposed rulemaking.
