# Lost in translation: how to get your data analysis + web-facing technologies to work together effectively

Far too often, there lies a wall between the techniques your company uses to grab customers' attention on the web and the analyses your company performs that ultimately pique customers' interest. As it normally goes, data analysis lives on someone's terminal or private repo, before it gets compiled into an internal document that is then distributed around outside of the analysis team. To make the memo short or deliver the big conclusions quickly, most of the techniques that are used to reach those conclusions remain obscured from view and often far from being reproducible. On the other hand, the maze of frameworks, competing web technologies, and changing user needs keeps data analysis from being interactive, growing the divide between the analysis and your ultimate consumer. R has been a programming language typically reserved for statistics; yet in the past few years, it has been extended with a host of packages that extend its reach to a broader audience, becoming one of the most used languages in data science. Through a framework called Shiny, data analysis can be shared easily in a responsive environment where web technologies + the underlying data techniques can play well together. I'll show you an example of how a data analysis pipeline can be extended with a server and a user interaction model in mind, connecting the strengths that your teams already have.
